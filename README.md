# Geometry Calculator

Project created by [Jonathan Chuang](https://jonathanchuang.me)

## Project Goal
This project will serve as a bridge between JavaScript and its compatibility with HTML. In further units, you will really dive into interactivity with JavaScript but this project will explore some basic tools to allow you to see how JS can change what you see on a web page.

**Suggested prerequisites:** Completion of lessons 1,2, and 3 of unit 2

**Main concepts:** Functions, basic APIs, loops, arrays

**Estimated time for completion:** 1 hour

## Overview
Your teacher needs your help! He wants to teach his students about geometry, specifically how to calculate area and volume for different shapes. He taught the concepts in class and gave out homework problems but he doesn't have time to grade everyone's homework. Instead, he wants you to create a web page where students can check their solution by typing in the homework problems and outputting the correct answers.

He has created the HTML page and CSS file but did not have time to create the corresponding JavaScript file. Can you help him out?

## How to download start files
1. Near the top right of the page, locate the "Clone or download" button. It should be bright green.
2. Click the button.
3. A mini-screen should pop up. Click "Download ZIP".
4. Open "Finder" or "File Explorer" on your desktop and drag the ZIP file to where you want to store these files.
5. Click on the ZIP files to unzip all of the files.

## Don't want to download the files?
1. Go to [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/)
2. On the top left of the page, click "Start Coding"
3. From "starer_code" folder, copy & paste each files content in to the corresponding spots for HTML, CSS, and JS code on CodePen

## Before starting
### HTML
If you've checked out the HTML code, you'll notice some things that we have yet to cover in our lessons: id tags & events.
### JavaScript
JavaScript is used to interact with the HTML code. Here are important APIs you will have to use to complete the project:
* `document.getElementById("idName")` returns an object with that id 
* `document.getElementsByName("name")` returns an array of objects with the name
* `.innerHTML` use this to modify the words
**Example:**
```
//TODO
```
**Tip:** Remember to get the capitalization and spelling correct when using these APIs or else your code won't work.

## Getting started
* Get familiar with the HTML and CSS code
* Locate the id tags & name tags
