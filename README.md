# Geometry

Project created by Jonathan Chuang

## Project Goal
This project will serve as a bridge between JavaScript and its compatibility with HTML. In further units, you will really dive into interactivity with JavaScript but this project will explore some basic tools to allow you to see how JS can change what you see on a web page.

**Suggested prerequisites:** Completion of lessons 1,2, and 3 of unit 2

**Main concepts:** Functions, basic APIs, loops, arrays

**Estimated time for completion:** 1 hour

## Overview
Your teacher needs your help! He wants to teach his students about geometry, specifically how to calculate area and volume for different shapes. He taught the concepts in class and gave out homework problems but he doesn't have time to grade everyone's homework. Instead, he wants you to create a web page where students can check their solution by typing in the homework problems and outputting the correct answers.

He has created the HTML page and CSS file but did not have time to create the corresponding JavaScript file. Can you help him out?
